how was how did devtinder database and users folder created

The devTinder database and users collection were created automatically by MongoDB and Mongoose when your app first saved a user document.

Here's how it happened:

Database Connection:
Your app connects to MongoDB using the connection string for the devTinder database.

User Model:
You defined a Mongoose model called User in user.js.

Saving Data:
When you called await user.save() in the /signup route, Mongoose created the users collection inside the devTinder database (if it didn't already exist) and inserted the user document.

MongoDB creates databases and collections automatically when you insert data for the first time. That's why you see devTinder and users in MongoDB Compass.

so "users" name was given automatically

Yes, the collection name "users" was given automatically by Mongoose.

When you use

Mongoose creates a collection named "users" (lowercase, pluralized) in MongoDB by default. This is standard Mongoose behavior.

can i change name

Yes, you can change the collection name in Mongoose by passing a third argument to mongoose.model. For example:

example:

Replace "customCollectionName" with your desired collection name. This will create/use that name in MongoDB instead of the default "users".

and how devtinder created

The devTinder database was created automatically by MongoDB when your app first connected and tried to save data.

When you use this connection string:

MongoDB will create the devTinder database if it does not already exist, as soon as you insert or save any data (like a user document). No manual setup is neededâ€”MongoDB handles this automatically.
